## Executive Overview
I design, scale, and operationalize deterministic AI platforms that satisfy executive governance standards while accelerating engineering throughput. My portfolio spans reproducible developer tooling, agentic workflow instrumentation, secure vector memory infrastructure, and the Vatrium AI meta IDE—a Windows-first environment where the assistant is empowered to recompose every surface to match stakeholder intent. I align cross-functional teams around measurable outcomes, translating compliance and safety expectations into maintainable code, policy, and automation.

## Signal Snapshot · 16 September 2025
| Indicator | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub portfolio | 14 public repositories, 11 total stars, 3 followers |
| Primary domains | Rust systems, Python data tooling, Go services, TypeScript DX |
| Delivery modes | Deterministic build pipelines, auditable evaluation suites, sealed supply chain controls |
| Collaboration model | Product squads, AI agent platforms, safety & compliance leads |

## Program Portfolio
| Program | Focus | Ownership & Momentum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ASTSentinel** | Deterministic AST instrumentation for Claude Code integrations; panic-free Rust policy, typed error handling, structured telemetry. | I serve as program owner; most recent hardening delivered 14 Sep 2025. |
| **ArchLens** | AI-assisted architecture analytics with MCP server, CLI, SDK surfaces enforcing SOLID guardrails and technical debt scoring. | I steward the product roadmap; architecture refresh landed 11 Aug 2025. |
| **CogniVault** | Pluggable Rust vector memory hub with async runtimes, encrypted sled persistence, and Ed25519-signed extension lifecycle. | I lead the platform; major iteration shipped 9 Jul 2025. |
| **SIGLA** | Local-first agent memory service featuring HNSW retrieval, SQLite+FTS5 storage, FastAPI interface, and offline fallbacks. | I direct technical delivery; offline benchmarks released 9 Sep 2025. |
| **Vatrium Meta Workspace** | First-of-its-kind AI-first Windows meta IDE: deterministic Bazel/Nix toolchains, VatUI GPU pipeline, AI meta-controller, and enterprise licensing orbiting the workspace at `C:\Users\1\Documents\GitHub\Vartium`. | I orchestrate the meta workspace and release automation; CI governance refresh completed 16 Sep 2025. |

## Flagship Platform · Vatrium AI Meta IDE
- **AI-reconfigurable interface:** `vatmeta_control` and `vatcap_router` route declarative `ui.*` actions so the assistant can rewrite panels, commands, and flows on demand without human-side recompile cycles.
- **Windows-first GPU stack:** Custom VatUI layers (winit, wgpu, render graph, text, layout, AccessKit) deliver 120–144 Hz interaction budgets with full accessibility control and zero dependency on external UI frameworks.
- **Zero-trust extensibility:** WASI- and native-plugin hosts pair with an Ed25519 marketplace (`vatmarket`) to verify bundles, MCP servers, and tool manifests before execution.
- **Policy and telemetry guardrails:** `vatpolicy` enforces SLO gates while instrumentation feeds structured telemetry (`ui.frame`, `gpu.present`, `feature.used:*`) for compliance-ready reporting.
- **Enterprise licensing posture:** Offline license verification (`vatlicense`) and entitlement-aware feature flags bifurcate community and commercial surfaces without touching the OSS stack.
- **Unified automation surface:** Deterministic `xtask` entry points, Bazel/Nix reproducibility, and `agents-validate` CI sequences keep OSS and PRO channels synchronized for air-gapped or regulated deployments.

## Value Pillars
- **Deterministic enablement:** I build instrumentation, constraint systems, and evaluation harnesses that retain reproducibility across IDE, MCP, and CI entry points.
- **Memory & knowledge infrastructure:** I engineer vector search and policy-aware persistence layers that respect security boundaries and runtime determinism.
- **Safety automation:** I integrate observability, policy enforcement, SBOM-driven risk controls, and zero-trust extension models into everyday workflows.
- **Enterprise alignment:** I translate executive expectations into roadmaps, KPIs, and release cadences that keep product, research, and compliance partners synchronized.

## Operating Principles
1. Every pipeline is auditable—reproducible builds, deterministic seeds, signed artifacts, and transparent metrics are non-negotiable.
2. Typed, panic-free error handling with structured logging protects the service contracts that AI agents and developers rely on.
3. Evaluation suites launch with the feature, not after it; I co-design coverage for safety, latency, and regression risks before release.
4. Default-deny posture governs extensions, data egress, and storage; controls become opt-in and monitored.

## 2025 Milestones
- **09 Jul:** Introduced CogniVault extension signature gate to secure runtime plug-ins.
- **11 Aug:** Delivered ArchLens architectural scoring refinements across MCP endpoints.
- **09 Sep:** Published SIGLA offline memory benchmark pack for constrained environments.
- **14 Sep:** Hardened ASTSentinel instrumentation with expanded panic-prohibition linting and telemetry coverage.
- **16 Sep:** Finalized Vatrium meta workspace CI governance and agent orchestration upgrades.

## Tooling & Infrastructure Standards
- Rust, Python, Go, and TypeScript with Bazel or Nix Flakes to enshrine reproducible dependency graphs.
- Observability through Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging, deterministic diff artifacts, and automated regression gates.
- SBOM generation via Syft and vulnerability intelligence with Grype, funneling into SARIF-enabled CI policy evaluation.
- Infrastructure-as-code disciplines anchored in Terraform and Kubernetes, complemented by zero-trust extension policies and sealed supply chain practices.

## Engagement Tracks
| Track | What I Deliver |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory | Architecture assessments, developer experience audits, AI governance playbooks ready for executive forums. |
| Platform Leadership | Standing up internal AI agent platforms, memory services, deterministic evaluation pipelines, and observability frameworks. |
| Strategic Partnership | Joint execution with security, legal, and compliance teams to launch AI capabilities within regulated or air-gapped environments. |
