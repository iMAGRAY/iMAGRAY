## Operating Principles
- Design documentation leads implementation; every initiative starts with architecture narratives, sequence diagrams and risk registers.
- API-first delivery ensures external and internal consumers benefit from consistent contracts, versioning and change management.
- Production-ready only: systems ship with observability, performance baselines, rollback strategies and on-call playbooks.
- Quantitative rigour: dashboards and experimentation metrics define success and inform iteration.
