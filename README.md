## Executive Overview
I design, scale, and operationalize deterministic AI platforms that satisfy executive governance standards while accelerating engineering throughput. My work spans reproducible developer tooling, agentic workflow instrumentation, and secure vector memory infrastructure. I align cross-functional teams around measurable outcomes, translating compliance and safety expectations into maintainable code, policy, and automation.

## Signal Snapshot · 16 September 2025
| Indicator | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub portfolio | 14 public repositories, 11 total stars, 3 followers |
| Primary domains | Rust systems, Python data tooling, Go services, TypeScript DX |
| Delivery modes | Deterministic build pipelines, auditable evaluation suites, sealed supply chain controls |
| Collaboration model | Product squads, AI agent platforms, safety & compliance leads |

## Program Portfolio
| Program | Focus | Ownership & Momentum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ASTSentinel** | Deterministic AST instrumentation for Claude Code integrations; panic-free Rust policy, typed error handling, structured telemetry. | I serve as program owner; most recent hardening delivered 14 Sep 2025. |
| **ArchLens** | AI-assisted architecture analytics with MCP server, CLI, SDK surfaces enforcing SOLID guardrails and technical debt scoring. | I steward the product roadmap; architecture refresh landed 11 Aug 2025. |
| **CogniVault** | Pluggable Rust vector memory hub with async runtimes, encrypted sled persistence, and Ed25519-signed extension lifecycle. | I lead the platform; major iteration shipped 9 Jul 2025. |
| **SIGLA** | Local-first agent memory service featuring HNSW retrieval, SQLite+FTS5 storage, FastAPI interface, and offline fallbacks. | I direct technical delivery; offline benchmarks released 9 Sep 2025. |

## Value Pillars
- **Deterministic enablement:** I build instrumentation, constraint systems, and evaluation harnesses that retain reproducibility across IDE, MCP, and CI entry points.
- **Memory & knowledge infrastructure:** I engineer vector search and policy-aware persistence layers that respect security boundaries and runtime determinism.
- **Safety automation:** I integrate observability, policy enforcement, SBOM-driven risk controls, and zero-trust extension models into everyday workflows.
- **Enterprise alignment:** I translate executive expectations into roadmaps, KPIs, and release cadences that keep product, research, and compliance partners synchronized.

## Operating Principles
1. Every pipeline is auditable—reproducible builds, deterministic seeds, signed artifacts, and transparent metrics are non-negotiable.
2. Typed, panic-free error handling with structured logging protects the service contracts that AI agents and developers rely on.
3. Evaluation suites launch with the feature, not after it; I co-design coverage for safety, latency, and regression risks before release.
4. Default-deny posture governs extensions, data egress, and storage; controls become opt-in and monitored.

## 2025 Milestones
- **09 Jul:** Introduced CogniVault extension signature gate to secure runtime plug-ins.
- **11 Aug:** Delivered ArchLens architectural scoring refinements across MCP endpoints.
- **09 Sep:** Published SIGLA offline memory benchmark pack for constrained environments.
- **14 Sep:** Hardened ASTSentinel instrumentation with expanded panic-prohibition linting and telemetry coverage.

## Tooling & Infrastructure Standards
- Rust, Python, Go, and TypeScript with Bazel or Nix Flakes to enshrine reproducible dependency graphs.
- Observability through Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging, deterministic diff artifacts, and automated regression gates.
- SBOM generation via Syft and vulnerability intelligence with Grype, funneling into SARIF-enabled CI policy evaluation.
- Infrastructure-as-code disciplines anchored in Terraform and Kubernetes, complemented by zero-trust extension policies and sealed supply chain practices.

## Engagement Tracks
| Track | What I Deliver |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory | Architecture assessments, developer experience audits, AI governance playbooks ready for executive forums. |
| Platform Leadership | Standing up internal AI agent platforms, memory services, deterministic evaluation pipelines, and observability frameworks. |
| Strategic Partnership | Joint execution with security, legal, and compliance teams to launch AI capabilities within regulated or air-gapped environments. |
