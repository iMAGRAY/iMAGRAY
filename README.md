# Amir Tlinov
**Principal AI Systems Engineer · Systems Strategist**

## Executive Summary
Amir Tlinov architects and delivers deterministic AI tooling, evaluation frameworks, and vector memory systems for engineering organizations that demand governance-grade transparency. Engagements span reproducible developer experiences, infrastructure observability, and agentic workflows hardened for regulated, air-gapped, or data-resident environments. Core strengths include cross-functional leadership, safety-first automation, and end-to-end delivery of measurable AI capabilities.

## Professional Footprint
| Indicator | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub presence | 14 public repositories, 11 cumulative stars, 3 followers (captured 16 September 2025) |

## Strategic Programs
| Program | Scope | Ownership & Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASTSentinel | Deterministic AST instrumentation for Claude Code integrations; panic-free Rust production policy, typed error handling, and structured telemetry for reproducible toolchains. | Program owner; last production hardening 14 September 2025 |
| ArchLens | AI-assisted architecture analytics platform with MCP server, CLI, and SDK surfaces that codify SOLID / architectural guardrails and technical debt measurement. | Product steward; recent architecture refresh 11 August 2025 |
| CogniVault | Pluggable Rust-based vector memory hub with async runtimes, encrypted sled persistence, and Ed25519-signed extension model for runtime isolation. | Platform lead; major iteration 9 July 2025 |
| SIGLA | Local-first agent memory service delivering HNSW search, SQLite+FTS5 storage, FastAPI interface, and offline fallbacks for constrained deployments. | Technical lead; offline memory enhancements 9 September 2025 |

## Capability Pillars
- **Deterministic AI enablement:** Builds instrumentation, constraint systems, and evaluation harnesses that keep AI-assisted coding flows reproducible across IDE, MCP, and CI contexts.
- **Memory and knowledge infrastructure:** Designs vector search, embedding orchestration, and policy-aware persistence layers optimized for security boundaries.
- **Safety and compliance automation:** Integrates observability, policy enforcement, and SBOM-driven supply chain controls into engineering workflows without sacrificing velocity.
- **Cross-functional leadership:** Aligns product management, research, platform, and reliability stakeholders around transparent KPIs and release cadences.

## Operating Principles
- Treat every pipeline as auditable: enforce reproducible builds, deterministic seeds, and signed extension artifacts across environments.
- Prefer typed, panic-free error handling with structured logging to maintain verifiable contracts for agent and developer tooling integrations.
- Co-design evaluation suites with end users, ensuring coverage for safety, latency, and regression objectives before feature rollout.
- Maintain policy-default secure posture: opt-in egress, encrypted storage, and measurable variance controls for all agent memory systems.

## Recent Milestones (2025)
- 9 July: Released CogniVault extension signature gate to protect runtime plug-ins.
- 11 August: Deployed ArchLens architectural scoring refinements across MCP endpoints.
- 9 September: Delivered SIGLA offline memory benchmark pack for constrained deployments.
- 14 September: Hardened ASTSentinel instrumentation with expanded panic-prohibition linting.

## Toolchain & Infrastructure Standards
- Rust, Python, Go, and TypeScript with reproducible dependency management (Bazel or Nix Flakes).
- Observability via Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logs, and deterministic diff artifacts.
- SBOM generation with Syft and vulnerability evaluation with Grype; CI-integrated SARIF reporting.
- Infrastructure-as-code disciplines using Terraform and Kubernetes with zero-trust extension policies.

## Engagement Options
- **Advisory engagements:** Architecture assessments, developer experience audits, and AI governance playbooks.
- **Platform leadership:** Standing up internal AI agent platforms, memory services, and deterministic evaluation pipelines.
- **Strategic partnerships:** Joint delivery with compliance, legal, and security teams to launch AI features in regulated contexts.
