## Executive Thesis
I partner with enterprise technology, product, and risk leaders to deliver deterministic AI platforms that remain auditable while adapting in real time to operator intent. My practice spans reproducible developer tooling, agentic workflow instrumentation, memory and knowledge infrastructure, and an AI-first IDE (Vatrium) that elevates assistants from helpers to interface authors. I design every program so that human intent translates into measurable service-level guardrails, signed supply-chain evidence, and velocity-aligned release playbooks.

## Signature Signals · 16 September 2025
| Indicator | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub portfolio | 14 public repositories, 11 stars, 3 followers |
| Core competencies | Rust systems design, Python data tooling, Go services, TypeScript developer experience |
| Active flagship platforms | ASTSentinel, ArchLens, CogniVault, SIGLA, Vatrium |
| Assurance coverage | Deterministic CI (`agents-validate`), Syft/Grype SBOM gating, Semgrep SAST, zero-trust extension policy |

## Platform Portfolio
| Platform | Core Focus | Current Trajectory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ASTSentinel** | Deterministic AST instrumentation for Claude Code with panic-free Rust policies, typed error surfaces, and structured telemetry contracts. | Production guardrails hardened 14 Sep 2025; expanding language coverage. |
| **ArchLens** | AI-assisted architecture analytics with MCP server, CLI, SDK, and SOLID/compliance scoring for complex services. | Architecture scoring refresh shipped 11 Aug 2025; onboarding enterprise pilot teams. |
| **CogniVault** | Pluggable Rust vector memory hub with async runtimes, encrypted persistence, and Ed25519-signed extension lifecycle. | Extension signature gate released 09 Jul 2025; scaling cross-region replication tests. |
| **SIGLA** | Local-first agent memory service offering HNSW retrieval, SQLite+FTS5 storage, FastAPI access, and offline fallbacks. | Offline memory benchmark pack delivered 09 Sep 2025; integrating deterministic regression suite. |
| **Vatrium AI Meta IDE** | Windows-first AI meta IDE with VatUI GPU pipeline, capability router, policy engine, and enterprise entitlement stack. | Meta workspace governance upgrade completed 16 Sep 2025; preparing guided preview launches. |

## Vatrium AI Meta IDE
- **Adaptive command surface:** `vatmeta_control` and `vatcap_router` orchestrate declarative `ui.*` actions so the assistant can reshape navigation, workflows, and theming on demand without human-side recompilation.
- **VatUI performance envelope:** Custom Rust stack (winit, wgpu, render graph, text, layout, AccessKit) sustains 120–144 Hz interaction budgets while preserving full accessibility control.
- **Assistant-directed customization:** Users can delegate layout reconfiguration, tool activation, and interface refactoring to the AI, producing tailored workspaces in response to natural requests.
- **Zero-trust plugin economy:** WASI/native hosts pair with `vatmarket` manifests, SHA-256 integrity, and Ed25519 signatures to authenticate extensions, MCP servers, and agent tools before execution.
- **Policy-driven operations:** `vatpolicy` enforces SLO gates and compliance switches, while telemetry (`ui.frame`, `gpu.present`, `feature.used:*`) feeds transparent dashboards for security, product, and operations stakeholders.
- **Enterprise-ready licensing:** `vatlicense` enables offline verification and entitlement-aware feature gating, keeping community and commercial surfaces isolated without duplicating code paths.

## Operating Doctrine
1. Design from intent: translate executive objectives into deterministic service levels, not aspirational slideware.
2. Make every pipeline auditable: reproducible builds, deterministic seeds, signed artifacts, and ledgered change logs.
3. Promote safety alongside velocity: co-design evaluation suites with stakeholders so releases ship with guardrails already armed.
4. Treat AI as a co-author: empower assistants to modify interfaces, policies, and playbooks while keeping humans in the approval loop.

## Assurance & Governance
- **Supply chain evidence:** Syft SBOMs and Grype vulnerability scans block release if critical issues emerge; results feed enterprise SARIF reporting.
- **Observability baseline:** Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging, and deterministic diff artifacts underpin incident analysis and proactive tuning.
- **Policy engine & SLO gates:** Runtime gates maintain latency, stability, and compliance thresholds even as AI-driven workflows evolve.
- **Deterministic verification:** Nextest, cargo-deny, Semgrep diff awareness, and Bazel/Nix parity keep OSS and commercial channels aligned for air-gapped deployments.

## 2025 Chronicle
- **09 Jul:** CogniVault extension signature gate secured runtime plug-ins and paved the way for regulated memory deployments.
- **11 Aug:** ArchLens architecture scoring refinements rolled out across MCP endpoints supporting portfolio rationalization.
- **09 Sep:** SIGLA offline memory benchmark pack enabled deterministic evaluations for constrained environments.
- **14 Sep:** ASTSentinel instrumentation hardened panic-prohibition linting and telemetry coverage.
- **16 Sep:** Vatrium meta workspace governance and agent orchestration upgrades aligned IDE automation with executive gatekeeping.

## Engagement Patterns
| Track | Outcomes | Typical Horizon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Executive Advisory** | Architecture assessments, governance playbooks, AI program audits ready for board and CxO forums. | 4–6 weeks |
| **Platform Stewardship** | Standing up AI agent platforms, memory services, deterministic evaluation pipelines, and observability frameworks. | 3–6 months |
| **Strategic Partnership** | Joint delivery with security, legal, and compliance teams to launch AI capabilities in regulated or air-gapped channels. | Multi-quarter |
